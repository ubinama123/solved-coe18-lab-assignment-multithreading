<strong>(Q.1,2,3 &amp; 9 are from previous fork assignment questions which are to be implemented in multithreaded fashion) </strong>

<ol>

 <li>Generate Armstrong number generation within a range.</li>

 <li>Ascending Order sort and Descending order sort.</li>

 <li>Implement a multithreaded version of binary search. By default, you can implement a search for the first occurrence and later extend to support multiple occurrence (duplicated elements search as well)</li>

</ol>

4.Generation of Prime Numbers upto a limit supplied as Command Line Parameter.

<ol start="5">

 <li>Computation of Mean, Median, Mode for an array of integers.</li>

 <li>Implement Merge Sort and Quick Sort in a multithreaded fashion.</li>

 <li>Estimation of PI Value using Monte carlo simulation technique (refer the internet for the method..) using threads.</li>

</ol>

<strong>Optional:</strong>

<ol start="8">

 <li>Computation of a Matrix Inverse using Determinant, Cofactor threads, etc.</li>

 <li>Read upon efficient ways of parallelizing the generation of Fibonacci series and apply the logic in a multithreaded fashion to contribute a faster version of fib series generation.</li>

</ol>
